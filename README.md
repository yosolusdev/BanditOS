# BanditOS

# Pre Disclaimers:
Bandit is a heavily stripped down windows ISO so some features will not be there and they will not work, so we recommend a stock Windows, with Bandit OS on another drive.
To install Bandit there is a pdf file in this repository what explains fully how to install and optimize the ISO to the best performance it can have.
Also, after post intallation tweaks do not apply more tweaks to the PC otherwise you will decrease performance because most likely that tweak is already added.


# Description
ðŸš€ Bandit OS is a Windows 10 gaming ISO with many components stripped down. We aim to provide more FPS and lower latency in every game. With components stripped, you will get less delay and more FPS.

Bandit is a early access ISO so there might be bugs, but Bandit has been pre-tweaked & stripped to provide the better performance along with our post installation tweaks.

Bandit is a ISO that takes some time to be fully tweaked, optimized and stripped on the day our development starts which is the 7th of March.

The ISO for Bandits is aimed to be released in May to give the developers a bit of time to make sure there is no errors or broken applications.

# What aspect of performance does the Bandit ISO increase?
Bandit increases things like,
Network Speed
Input Delay (Latency)
FPS
General Day To Day Use
